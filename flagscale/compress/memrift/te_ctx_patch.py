"""
TransformerEngine ctx-weight release patch for MemRift.

Problem
-------
TE's custom autograd Functions (_LayerNormMLP, _LayerNormLinear, _Linear) store
materialized weight tensors directly on the autograd ctx via attribute assignment
(e.g. `ctx.fc1_weight = fc1_weight`, `ctx.weight = weight`, `ctx.weight_object = weight`).

These bypass PyTorch's `saved_tensors_hooks`, so MemRift's WeightPlaceholder cannot
intercept them. The ctx object is destroyed only when the autograd engine releases
the corresponding backward node, which for LoRA + frozen base happens AFTER all
backward gradients are computed. Result: all 32 decoder layers' bf16 weights stay
pinned on GPU throughout backward = ~15 GB leak.

Fix
---
Monkey-patch each TE Function's `backward` method to clear ctx attributes
that hold weight references right before returning. This ensures the weight ref
is dropped as soon as this layer's backward finishes, freeing the GPU memory
for the next layer's prefetch/materialize.

Usage
-----
Call `patch_te_ctx_release()` once after `import transformer_engine`.
